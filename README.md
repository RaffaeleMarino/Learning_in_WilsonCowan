## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of the algorithms and experiments described in the paper "Learning in Wilson-Cowan Model for metapopulation (https://arxiv.org/abs/xxx)". The goal is to provide  a transparent and reproducible set of tools to verify and extend the findings of our work.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is structured as follows:

- `src/`: Source code for the main algorithms and models.
- `data/`: Sample datasets used in the experiments.
- `experiments/`: Scripts to reproduce the experiments and generate results.
- `results/`: Generated results from the experiments.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration.
- `docs/`: Additional documentation and resources.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for preprocessing and other tasks.

## Requirements

To run the code, you will need the following software and libraries:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xxx
```

## Usage

To run the main experiments, use the following command:

```bash
python src/xxx
```

## Reproducing Results

To reproduce the results presented in the paper, follow these steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Download and prepare the datasets as described in the `data/README.md` file.
2. **Running Experiments**: Execute the experiment scripts located in the `experiments/` directory.
3. **Analyzing Results**: Generated results will be saved in the `results/` directory. You can use the provided Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for detailed analysis and visualization.

Example command to run an experiment:

```bash
python experiments/experiment_name.py
```
